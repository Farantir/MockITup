# MockITup

### What is MockITup?
MockITup is an Easy to use tool to create quick app mockups.
You can use custom images and desing nice looking prototypes
with a lot of funktionality, or you can build very simple
early prototypes in a few Seconds.

A live version can be found [here](https://jhippe.de/MockITup/)

### How to use it
select the orientation of your app (landscape/portrait).
You can add different screens by pressing the + and add components to existing ones by dragging them from the manu on the left onto a screen.

By switching to the logick tap, you can define interaktions. 
First klick on the Element that should evoke an aktion (e.g. a button).
Select the Event that should evoke the aktion (e.g. click)
now klick on the target (e.g. the next screen)
and then select the aktion that should be performed (e.g. change to this screen)

you can always test your creation by clicking on the test tab.
To test the mockup on your device, go to the test on device tab and scan the qr code.

It is also possible to create custom elements with the simple scetch tool and to create Animations for elements, that can then be triggert or used as trigger in the logick tap.

### How do i deploy it?
if you have a webserver with php installed, simply download and 
extrackt the .zip file into your web directory and you are ready to go.

if you dont have a webserver you can still use the application by doubleclicking
the index.html. However, you wont be able to use the "Test on device" function.
